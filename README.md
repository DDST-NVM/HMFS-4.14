# Introduction

We are now working to transport hm(v)fs codes from linux kernel 3.11.0 to 4.14 (Fedora 27). 

The integration procedure falls into three steps:

1. Debug hmfs codes on linux 4.14;
2. Build hmfs on AEP machine with HW-individual modules;
3. Write demo on AEP machine.

## NOTICE

1. All software and dependencies should be installed manually but not via Internet (i.e., we have to download rpms for gcc, libcurves and so on)
2. To be added.
