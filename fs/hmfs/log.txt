# Notes for mounting HMFS-4.14

Hello, everyone. I have successfully compile hmfs.ko and installed it on my machine.

I try to mount it on a self-created dir /tmp/test and there is some error info.

I recorded them to share with you.

*1. The first one is the signature issue: I added 'MODULES_CONFIG_SIG=n' in the first line of Makefile, since it really worked in AEP machine;

*2. The second is memory registering: i fail to reserve a memory region for hmfs by modifying grub.cfg. Better first see the usable memory via 'dmesg | grep e820' and then add 'memmap=AG(M)\$BG(M)' to reserve AG(M) memory space from start address BG(M).
